# Farm System Improvement Tasks

## Architecture and Design
- [ ] Implement proper layered architecture with clear separation of concerns
- [ ] Create comprehensive documentation for the system architecture
- [ ] Implement design patterns consistently across the codebase
- [ ] Develop a consistent error handling strategy
- [ ] Create API documentation for all public interfaces
- [ ] Implement proper dependency injection instead of direct instantiation

## Code Quality
- [ ] Fix typo in class name: Rename `EntitiyDTOConvertor` to `EntityDTOConverter`
- [ ] Fix typo in class name: Rename `SQlUtil` to `SQLUtil`
- [ ] Standardize naming conventions across the codebase
- [ ] Remove duplicate methods (e.g., `getById` and `findById` in CustomerDAOImpl)
- [ ] Remove unused imports (e.g., EmployeeEntity in CustomerDAOImpl)
- [ ] Fix the bug in `getIemDto` method that causes circular reference
- [ ] Add proper JavaDoc comments to all classes and methods
- [ ] Implement consistent exception handling
- [ ] Remove debug print statements (e.g., in CustomerBOImpl.getNextID)
- [ ] Fix inconsistent method naming (e.g., some use "On" in action methods, others don't)

## Database Management
- [ ] Implement connection pooling for better performance
- [ ] Move database credentials to a configuration file
- [ ] Fix resource leaks in SQLUtil by properly closing connections, statements, and result sets
- [ ] Implement transaction management
- [ ] Create a database migration strategy
- [ ] Fix SQL injection vulnerability in query detection in SQLUtil
- [ ] Make the DBConnection singleton implementation thread-safe
